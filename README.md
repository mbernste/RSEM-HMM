This project implements the RNA-seq Expectation Maximization algorithm for estimating the gene and
isophorm expression levels in RNA-seq data.

The original paper by Bo Li and Colin Dewey can be found here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/323

The goal of this project is to add the ability for the algorithm to make accurate estimates with the presence
of indels.
