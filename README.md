RSEM
====
Final project for CS776 - Advanced Bioinformatics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

This project implements a simplified version of the RNA-Seq Expectation Maximization algorithm decribed here: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/4/493.full.  

A paper describing their implementation of the algorithm can
be found here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/323

Their actual implementation can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/bli25wisc/RSEM

This project also implements an extended version of the RSEM algorithm that uses hidden Markov models for modeling insertions and deletions between the read sequences and reference transcripts.
